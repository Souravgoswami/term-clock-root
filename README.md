      `ruby term-clock.rb`

  + Fonts: The noto-fonts and noto-fonts-emoji are neededto display unicode characters used in this program.

  + For other distribution, term-clock root installer will be coming soon.

# Converter
Let me talk about the ![converter](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/term-clock/blob/master/character_converter.rb) a bit.
It converts all the characters in the characters.txt to something else you specify. It isn't directly related to term-clock, but if you are interested, run `ruby character_converter.rb -c='your_character'` where your character is a single digit character. Note that this and term-clock is only tested on various GNU/Linux systems.
